# Mask-Placement-Devices

With the current pandemic people are required to wear masks when going out in public. 
Putting on a mask requires dexterity and mobility in the arms.
Those who do not have this mobility face difficulties when putting on masks.
The goal of this project is to design solutions that make putting on a mask more accessible and easier.
